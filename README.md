## Project Status

### Project Problems
1. Video resizing/editing/uploading is very expensive and hosting it on cloudinary is not a good solution
2. Time (I need more of this, this project was primarily a quarantine project for me and my brother)
3. The project has about 0 testing (oops)
4. While most things are cross phone compatible Apples iPhone X bar at the top causes a few issues

### Still Needs Done
1. Utilize local phone storage to store area info ( similar to mountain projects downloading area)
2. Use refresh tokens to make app more secure
3. Need to implement the climbing game(Halfdome climber) that I developed along with it
4. Ability to change grades between differnt systems (YDS, UIAA, British)
5. Do a better job at showing user climbing stats
6. Many more things

#### Footnotes
<b id="f1">1</b> All screenshots were taken on a Google Pixel(1st Gen). More images can be provided to show cross phone compatability [â†©](#a1)
